            <p> My favorite book series is Harry Potter because it is super magical and has a big storyline and most of it is still a mystery. It makes it so much more intresting and once you read 1 book, you will feel like you need to read the other books. also the characters are so unique and don't seem like they were copied from another place whatsoever. I know you might not like Harry Potter in the beginning, but once you finish the chapter "Keeper of the Keys" in the first book, I bet you will be hooked in the world of harry potter. So give Harry Potter a shot and be pulled in the world of Harry Potter!</p>
